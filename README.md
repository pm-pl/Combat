# Combat
Combat is an open source [PocketMine-MP](https://pmmp.io/) plugin preventing players from getting out of fights.

## Features
- Configurable **Cooldown** for combat timer.
- Optional **ScoreHud** support using the `combat.cooldown` tag.
- Configurable list of **blocked commands and subcommands** for players who are in combat.
- Optionally **kill** players who try to log off while in combat.

## Known Bugs
- When someone dies while leaving the server and joins back, they will be in a weird glitched state where they wont be able to see other players. I cannot do anything about this in this plugin as it is a [pocketmine bug](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/issues/5385).
